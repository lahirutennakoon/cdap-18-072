                            <h2>Literature Review</h2>

                        </header>

                        <p>

                            In recent years, there have been number of research efforts done to address the needs a smart e-learning management system. Below are some of the software functionalities and technologies that has been done prior to our research. Undertaking a Literature Survey helps us on finding and come up with the followings.
                            Regardless of the enormous growth of e-learning (electronic learning) in education and its perceived benefits, the efficiency of such e-learning systems will not be fully utilized if the students are not inclined to accept and use the system.
                            As a result, successful implementation of e-learning tools depends on whether the students are willing to adopt and accept the technology. Thus, it has become imperative for e-learning system developers to understand the factors affecting the user acceptance of web-based learning systems in order to enrich the students’ learning experience and to create a better product to fulfill the necessary requirements of the student.
                            “Use of E-Learning”, a research was done to find University students’ purpose to use e-learning [1]. In this research, Teknologi Malaysia University’s students try to apply and use the theory of technology acceptance model (TAM). They have employed structural equation modeling (SEM) approach with a SmartPLS software to investigate students’ adoption process. Discoveries indicate that the content of e-learning and self-efficacy have a positive impact and substantially associated with perceived usefulness and student satisfaction, which impact university students’ purpose to use e-learning. Although e-learning has expanded acceptance in universities around the world, the study of the intention to use e-learning is still essentially unexplored in Malaysia. The developed model is employed to explain the university student’s intention to use e-learning. The study concludes that university students in Malaysia have positive perceptions towards e-learning and intend to practice it for educational purposes.
                            E-Learning is reflected as an innovative approach to education delivery via electronic forms of information. Multiple researches have been done to find the best way to use the technology and to better fit the students’ necessities [1], [2]. The main obstacles that need to be addressed are the insufficient financial support, inadequate training programs, lack of ICT infrastructure, equivocal policies and objectives, and lack of awareness, interest, and motivation toward e-learning technology are considered as the main obstacles to enhance e-learning in Iraqi universities. The lack of training programs and inadequate ICT infrastructure are considered as the key issues which obstruct advancing of the e-learning process in Iraq [2].
                            Online body tracking by a PTZ camera has been done before to automatically track a single person and focus on that person [3], [4]. Online human body tracking method by an IP PTZ camera based on fuzzy-feature scoring was done. At every frame, candidate targets are detected by extracting moving targets using optical flow, a sampling, and appearance. The target is determined among samples using a fuzzy classifier. Results show that the system has a good target detection precision (> 88%), and the target is almost always localized within 1/4th of the image diagonal from the image center [3]. Autonomous lecture recording with a PTZ camera [4]. This reaches the same viewing experience while watching lectures recorded by an automated system. To accomplish this, they have developed an automatic cameraman (PTZ camera-unit) that is able to, Detect and track a single person/lecturer, Change between different types of shots, Listen to high-level instructions from a virtual or human director, and Take cinematographic rules into account
                            By tracking the lecturer, he is framed well in the picture at any moment and viewers can’t be distracted. Takes cinematographic rules into account, which ensures that the viewer remains focused and the viewing experience is aesthetically more interesting. The action axis is determined by calculating the direction of movement and the gaze orientation. A PID control loop ensures smooth movement of the camera. Because of the speed of the algorithm, it will be easy to downscale for embedded hardware and still perform the calculations real-time.
                            Remote controlling of the PTZ camera system for lecture rooms [5]. This consist of a simple and inexpensive software solution for remote management of PTZ camera systems.  This provides the ability for users to remotely control the PTZ camera system from one place with the simultaneous image capturing ability. Users of this application are able to choose a number of presets and this functionality is provided programmatically by sending queries to CCTV system, which then responds back to the controller. All of the responses are processed immediately into the desired form and stored in a selected row in SQLite database. This method of data storage doesn´t require the installation of SQL database, which makes the solution easier to apply. The program was created using the programming language C#. But this software solution does not support real-time tracking of a person, just several predefined presets so that feature can be improved to real-time operation in Lecture Capturing System.  OpenTrack - Automated Camera Control for Lecture Recordings [6] records lecture sessions automatically without the need for a human camera person.  A Tabletop Lecture Recording System [7]. This research presents a lecture recording system that employs gestures and digital cameras to facilitate remote distance teaching. Virtual Cameraman [8] uses two PTZ cameras having different utilities. One is named full-shot PTZ camera and the other is movement PTZ camera. To get camera movement information, the system first obtains continuous images from full-shot PTZ camera and then extracts four fuzzified movement features which can represent four characters of audiences' motions respectively. On the other hand, an automatic camera movement model (ACMM) is constructed by recording photographers' habit of CM styles and shot types. The proposed system can select suitable CM styles and shot types by inputting the fuzzified motion features into the ACMM. After that, the system chooses the main target in the input frames obtained from the full-shot PTZ camera by using five aesthetic criteria. Finally, the system operates the movement PTZ camera to finish recording.
                            Real-time body tracking has been implemented before, but not quite as what we have planned on doing; real-time broadcasting of the footage without any delay. The complete package of having the lecture capturing along with audience if necessary, screen sharing, Face Recognition based remote login and attendance marking for online participants, viewing the lecture in real-time with added features such as reading what the lecturer has told and intelligently generating chapters on the video according to the lecture slides played alongside with this makes Lecture Capturing System a perfect complete package of e-learning. A thorough research related to e-learning systems has led to the identification of some of the most influential factors used in the field of information systems research. More specifically, characteristics as well as the limitations, weaknesses, and strengths of web-based learning systems. Student variables, such as technical issues and adapting to the new ways are important variables that influence student learning, especially in a collaborative e-learning environment. Understanding these variables is now helpful for developers to design eloquent educational activities to promote student knowledge construction and make learning more effective and appealing. In particular, this research helps to better understand the characteristics of students and to comprehend what the students expect from the learning management systems. This can help the developers achieve the most effective deployment of such systems and also helps them improve their strategic decision making about technology in the future, they can decide on the best approach that fit their students before implementing any new technology.

                        <!--<p>Usually, a data warehouse is refreshed periodically with data gathered from disparate source systems. Nevertheless this data might not be fully accurate, probably containing serious data quality problems, such as uniqueness, misrepresentations, null values, multi-purpose fields, or inconsistent values, for one or more attributes. This is a major contribution to the falling expectations users have on data analyzed from data warehouses. Data quality enforcement is a complex time consuming task that parses data from source tables and corrects it, normalizes it and integrates it into a data warehouse for a better representation of real businesses. The primary goal of the development of a Data Warehousing System (DWS) is to provide the organization with a conformed, integrated and centralized repository that in turn can help management, through data analysis, make decisions based on facts instead of intuition. Nevertheless, the development of such a project is very resource demanding, with a high level of complexity and with previously unknown setbacks that can undermine the success of the project. The quality of source data is one of them. Source systems, which tend to be OLTP systems supporting regular business activities, normally contain inaccurate data, unknown or null data and sometimes inconsistent data that are spread generally by operational systems’ objects, constraints or rules. This imposes to include in data warehouses’ populating systems – usually recognized simply by Extract- Transform-Load (ETL) processes - cleansing tasks in order to detect and filter (and sometimes recovering) all those data anomalies in the source’s data before loading it into a data warehouse (DW). Although ETL processes have been subject of extensive research mainly in the conceptual and logical design as well as all the aspects related to data quality that are one of the most important issues on the success of any populating process. So, cleansing tasks are undoubtedly important. They are mainly concerned with identifying problems in metadata and data, i.e., inconsistencies at attribute and row level, rather than defining a strategy to execute the procedures needed to deal with those problems.-->

                        <!--<p>In machine learning, one of the main requirements is to build computational models with a high ability to generalize well the extracted knowledge. When training e.g. artiﬁcial neural networks, poor generalization is often characterized by over-training. A common method to avoid over-training is the hold-out cross- validation. The basic problem of this method represents, however, appropriate data splitting. In most of the applications, simple random sampling is used. Nevertheless, there are several sophisticated statistical sampling methods suitable for various types of datasets. Z. Reitermanova in Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Prague, Czech Republic shows that a survey of existing sampling methods applicable to the data splitting problem. Supporting experiments evaluating the beneﬁts of the selected data splitting techniques involve artiﬁcial neural networks of the back-propagation type. According to Z. Reitermanova research paper we have identified below features which is important for our research area In machine learning, one of the main requirements is to build computational models with high prediction and generalization capabilities. In the case of supervised learning, a computational model is trained to predict outputs of an unknown target function. The target function is represented by a ﬁnite training dataset T of examples of inputs and the corresponding desired outputs: T = {[~x1 , ~ d1 ], ... , [~xn , ~ dn ]}, where n > 0 is the number of ordered pairs of input/output samples(patterns). At the end of the training process, the ﬁnal model should predict correct outputs for the input samples from T, but it should also be able to generalize well to previously unseen data. Poor generalization can be characterized by over-training.-->
